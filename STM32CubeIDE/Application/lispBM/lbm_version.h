/*! \page changelog Changelog

Nov 9: Version 0.7.1
  - Bugfix: string literal lengths.
  - not-eq and != added.
  - Corrected behaviour for eval when applied to no argument.
  - lbm_memory operations are protected by mutex.
  - Fixes to eval-program.
  - Added multiple condition conditional function called cond.

Oct 31: Version 0.7.1
  - Added optional boolean guards to pattern matches.
  - Built in map and reverse.

Oct 16: Version 0.7.0
  - Refactoring for evaluation speed.
  - Removed possibility to step through code.
  - Oldest message is removed on mailbox full.
  - Added spawn-trap inspired by Erlang (but simplified).

Sep 25: Version 0.7.0
  - Removed namespaces (they were too restricted).
  - Mailboxes are now stored in arrays of default size 10 mails.
    Mailbox size can be changed using set-mailbox-size.

Sep 16 2022: Version 0.6.0
  - Source code can be streamed onto the heap. This means there is no need
    for a large buffer on the MCU (or area of flash) to parse source code
    from

Sep 5 2022: Version 0.6.0
  - Refactoring of array-reader. Array reading is nolonger done monolithically
    inside of the tokpar framework, but rather as a cooperation between the
    evaluator and the tokenizer.

Sep 3 2022: Version 0.6.0
  - Round-robin scheduling + Addition of an Atomic construct to use with care.

Aug 1 2022: Version 0.5.4
  - Easing use of the LBM library from C++ code.

Jul 25 2022: Version 0.5.4
  - lbm_define can now create variables (#var) in variable memory from
    the C side of things.
  - Simple namespaces.

Jul 18 2022: Version 0.5.4
  - Added pattern matching support for i64, u64 and double.
  - Fixed issue with pattern matching on i32, u32.

Jul 17 2022: Version 0.5.4
  - Refactoring with readability in focus.
  - Computing encodings of commonly used symbol constants (for eval_cps) at compile time
    rather then repeatedly at runtime.

Jul 13 2022: Version 0.5.4
  - Added function that lookups based on the second field in assoc structures.
    Called it "cossa" as it is like assoc but backwards.

Jul 4 2022: Version 0.5.4
  - Added possibility to partially apply closures. A partially applied closure
    is again a closure.

May 24 2022: Version 0.5.3
  - Fixed bug related to float-array literals not accepting whole numbers unless containing a decimal (0).

May 22 2022: Version 0.5.3
  - Fixed bug that could cause problems with call-cc on 64bit platforms.
  - bind_to_key_rest continuation refactoring to use indexing into stack.
  - Fix evaluator bug in progn that made tail-call not fire properly when there
    is only one expr in the progn sequence.

May 10 2022: Version 0.5.3
 - symbols starting with "ext-" will be allocated into the extensions-list
   and can on the VESC version of lispbm be dynamically bound to newly loaded
   extensions at runtime.

May 8 2022: Version 0.5.2
 - Added new macros for 10, 12 and 14K lbm_memory sizes.

May 5 2022: Version 0.5.2
 - Line and column numbers associated with read errors.
 - More explanatory descriptions in error messages related to read errors.

May 2 2022: Version 0.5.2
 - Performance tweaks to the evaluator. Small but positive effect.

May 1 2022: Version 0.5.2
 - Added lbm_stack_reserve for allocating multiple words on stack
   in one function call (and one check on stack limits).

Apr 19 2022: Version 0.5.2
 - Added a reader_done_callback that is run when a context is done
   with a reading task.
 - Array-literal syntax.
 - Restructure symbol evaluation for efficiency and readability.
 - Rewrite progn to update stack in place when possible.
 - Removed a bunch of convertion back and forth from C and LBM representation
   of continuation identifiers in eval_cps. They are now compared in encoded
   form in the evaluator.
 - Added lbm_cadr and replaced lbm_car(lbm_cdr(x)) with lbm_cadr(x) in
   the evaluator.

Apr 10 2022: Version 0.5.1
 - Removed the prelude.lisp, prelude.xxd step of building LBM.
 - A continuation created by call-cc can be applied to 0 or 1 argument.
   If there are 0 arguments an implicit application to nil takes place.

Mar 26 2022: Version (0.5.0)
 - Optimized code-path for closure applications.
 - 64 and 32 bit support from a single source code
 - Added math extensions library from Benjamin Vedder
 - Added String manipulation extensions library from Benjamin Vedder

Mar 10 2022: Version (0.4.2)
 - Added the lbm_set_error_reason function.

Mar 02 2022: Version (0.4.2)
 - Bug fix in initialization of contexts.

Feb 28 2022: Version (0.4.2)
 - First go at human-readable error messages.
 - Finished contexts are immediately and completely removed.
 - Context ids are now set to the index into the lbm_memory
   where the context structure is stored.

Feb 21 2022: Version (0.4.1)
 - Bug fixes in gc related to arrays


Feb 20 2022: Version (0.4.0)
 - Adds support for macros.
 - Adds call-cc for escaping and abortive continuations.

Feb 17 2022: version 0.3.0
 - Added lbm_undefine to c_interop.
 - Added lbm_share_array to c_interop.
 - Added lbm_create_array to c_interop.
 - #var variables with more efficient storage and lookup.
   variables are set using `setvar`.
 - Spawn optionally takes a number argument before the closure argument
   to specify stack size.
 - Extensions are stored in an array and occupy a range of dedicated symbol values.

Feb 14 2022: version 0.2.0
 - Added GEQ >= and LEQ <= comparisons.

Feb 13 2022: version 0.1.1
 - Bug fix in handling of environments in progn.

Feb 11 2022: version 0.1.0
